# Do well on this (Good portfolio for future)

# Learn git
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2


Test 123
# Need new name! (Timewise was taken)
- Chrono(has to do with time)
- ChronoCollab? (Chrono for time and collab for collaboration feature?)
- Logo idea (a clock with someone in it thinking) - pretty funny 

# Make sure to: (Will be useful for ux interviews) -> Can show other skills as well 
- Storyboard
- Wireframe
- Low fidelity
- High Fidelity
- Build dynamic user interface
- Desktop(first) -> Mobile after(Tablet similar) (Main focus is we want mobile apps since ppl mainly use mobile + possibly teachers rec (extension))

# Architecture
- Tbd (options from 491a) could be researched as well
- https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bxTOZwitzjhmTFufEfJMXENnGJ55q0rueyiIf_aYGHU/edit?usp=sharing 
  

# Ideas (Based off of google calendar/canvas calendar + sidebar + features(Collaboration, ai, Friends, customization)

- For app can add feature where you can put importance(Example:Justin couldn't hang out cause dad home)(Red:Important)(Orange/yellow kind of possible could change)(Green:Free)
- Stamp for day of completion on calendar
- When creating a task with conflicting times (if statement) if there is conflicting time ask user are you sure that you want to make it this time if so -> ai recommendation confirm ys or no
- Gps(feature plans) meet up can track all locations members customized  pfps
- regular feature -> duolingo charcter streak (Also regular analytics + github streak/green thingy a lot of tutorials on it)
- Using framer for frontend/landing page: Contacts,Home, Signup, Login, Logo(need new logo) (I think a few more are missing need to research other sites)
- Backend(Justin will cover)
- Focus on ai features companies still haven't used it on recommendation/calendar
- Collaboration feature(Friends + notifs + add to groups calendars)
- For customization similar to discord(all simple color gradients + just regular free dark and light mode - button like twitch dark and light mode)
- When inviting someone (group for events - can put checkmark or x on event to see who is coming and who is not) - Group leaders can send it out it will be like a google doc (to elaborate on this can add further detail where you can put comments for specific ppl for example like Justin bring waterbottles to event) - so only those specific ppl can see their own reminder

- comment and it will update on the calendar for hover (Can put a time period on it so it disappears after the date or before the date - should automatically be set to the date but able to change) (also add option for see later if bothering the person like next time turn on the app or in an hour)
- For Check in feature make it able to turn it off (Customizable finish features like when a task is finished animation/signifier showing its finished -> goes back to like github that shows streak or how many days in a row)
- Also need to change name of company there is a company called timewise already
- Feature(extra check in/list -> Most important to least important (Red, Yellow, Greeen) for adhd folks easier 
- Feature where ai knows when u are most active and awake based off of usage time(could use built in phone features - Used for data and timely reminders)
- Settings (Since we have a lot of options settings pages are usually where people are most confused so making it simple is prior)
- Feature where it counts how many hours u do something(Nelson shadows for Dr. Ant -> tracks how many hours of shadowing he has done) (Prob in the stats with everything else will and can be apart of monthly/yearly stats Spotify recapped but can check regularly)

# Frontend (We using react)
- We need a new logo! (Future could hire an actual professional - If we are using Chrono then something futuristic - I don't like a calendar logo)
- Home -Contact - About us -services (sign up and login button top right)
- Use (Figmae optional) framer -> code 

# Main Features
- (Important Usability simple intuitive) - an old man could use it
- Calendar (Simple interface like Apple or google preferably google)
- Justin wants a guest feature 
  
- Collaboration (should be called groups) would be a tab on the sidebar and assign group leaders similar to Discord you can name and give the role 
  - Send group announcements (Can send to specific group members)
  - Share what days are free with friends
  - (Hang out with people dont really know them) -> Send sched for a month
    
- Ai (recommends and optimizes schedule changes)
  - Feature where ai knows when u are most active and awake based off of usage time(could use built in phone features - Used for data and timely reminders)
    
- Customizability
  - (Like discord - For now prob some temporary regular colors but later can use gradients)
  - Stamp for day of completion on calendar
  - Fun achievement system -> instead of a level system you can get an achievemnt or badge on your profile like 30 days consistent 60 90 180 1 year -> 2 year and so on or like things like did specifc actions or very hard working or connect to spotify recap kinda thing when it shows stat like Number 21 hardest worker
    
- Sidebar
  - Similar to discord calendar on far left
    - Middle will have checkins + upcoming events
  - (Can have light or dark mode button similar to twitches where when you press on pfp it shows options settings etc with dark and light mode)
  -  (Also just can have simplified icons although should have words saying what but should be able to disable in settings)
  - Settings should be simple inutitve when using settings its usually difficult to find certain features
   - Stats
      - Feature where it counts how many hours u do something(Nelson shadows for Dr. Ant -> tracks how many hours of shadowing he has done)
      - Spotify Recap
        - End of year can take stats like Birthday -> example "Out of all the 23 year olds you are this percentile in finishing your task and consistent!" opt in opt out settigns - Fun features
      - Duolingo streak/github tracker
      - Easter egg meet the team - Tap each letter of a person of the team in order to get to a meet the team
    
- Extra
  
- Voice feature adding dates and stuff onto sched
- Extension(either scrapes and puts data on our app our adds our app to like google or apple)
- Can add texting for discussing group activities
  - Invite friends to group calendar (Invite link to group calendar, invite qr code to group calendar)

# Desgin Features
https://x.com/60fpsdesign/status/1808191652131230136 (This design feature highlights some key features that we need obviously some good design is the signifier that something is missing

# Competitors (Ai has been going down but productivity tools have been doing well)

- Notions although good with productivity with most people it has a steep learning curve with all of its tools


August 8th - Working on the profile pic similar to discord with twitch features discussing with justin whether to have picture bottom left or top right 
- Also need to make buttons bigger since there is a lot of space!
<img width="1440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/258be403-81fc-438e-99a8-c1251a6c4ba9">
Moved to bottom left very good tried top right didnt look right to me just need to implement some buttons now
<img width="1439" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e20ae8e8-9731-433f-bc7c-26ce845d259e">
added discord like sidebar kept profile on bottom left added check in + task list made it collapsable(Gotta add upcoming events)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38c3c23c-a70c-41e0-8013-5ef6aea7554b)


When refactoring code need to refix some features again (Profile pic, Top buttons, Calendar fix, add button + profile pic actually saves events and profile pic + name)
<img width="1440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd692b9a-e9d4-4635-a2a5-933ddcc45376">

Fixed Top buttons, calendar pic, collapse
need to fix (Profile pc feature + name + task button)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1aefac0a-8f17-4783-b022-694a2e5882f7)


Made it so that when you press on profile the bar goes above only new issue (Make it so that when you press on the profile while collapsed the profile stays at tsame position + making the bar light mode when light mode and darkmode when darkmode
